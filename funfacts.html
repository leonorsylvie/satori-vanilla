                    <p class="facts__description">Did you know that the term "espresso" comes from the Italian word meaning "pressed out"? This fascinating brewing method has a rich history dating back to the late 19th century, when Angelo Moriondo patented the first steam-driven "instantaneous" coffee machine in Turin, Italy. <br><br>However, it wasn't until the early 20th century that Luigi Bezzera invented a more refined version of the espresso machine, which utilized both pressure and steam to create a concentrated shot of coffee in a matter of seconds. Today, espresso is not just a drink; it's a cultural icon, enjoyed by millions around the world for its intense flavor and versatility in creating a wide range of coffee beverages.</p>

                    <h1 class="facts__name">Pour-Over<hr class="divider d2" size="2" color="black"></h1>
                    <p class="facts__description">The pour-over brewing method has been around for centuries, but it gained widespread popularity in the early 20th century thanks to the invention of the paper coffee filter by German housewife Melitta Bentz in 1908. This simple yet ingenious innovation revolutionized the way coffee was brewed, allowing for a cleaner and more flavorful cup without the need for cloth filters or complicated brewing apparatus. <br><br>Pour-over coffee enthusiasts praise its ability to highlight the unique characteristics of different coffee beans, as well as its hands-on approach that allows for greater control over the brewing process.</p>

                    <h1 class="facts__name">Cold Brew<hr class="divider d1" size="2" color="black"></h1>
                    <p class="facts__description">Did you know that cold brew coffee typically has a lower acidity level than traditional hot-brewed coffee? This results in a smoother, less bitter flavor profile that's perfect for enjoying on a hot day or as a refreshing pick-me-up anytime. The cold brew craze has taken the coffee world by storm in recent years, with its rise in popularity attributed to its mellow flavor, long shelf life, and versatility in creating a variety of coffee-based beverages. <br><br>Unlike hot brewing methods that use heat to extract flavor from the coffee grounds, cold brew relies on time, steeping coarse coffee grounds in cold water for an extended period (usually 12-24 hours) to achieve a rich and complex flavor profile.</p>

                    <h1 class="facts__name">Cortado<hr class="divider d2" size="2" color="black"></h1>
                    <p class="facts__description">The cortado originated in Spain and means "cut" in Spanish. The name comes from the way the espresso is "cut" with a small amount of warm milk, creating a balanced and creamy coffee drink. This simple yet delicious beverage has its roots in Spanish coffee culture, where it's enjoyed as a mid-morning pick-me-up or an afternoon indulgence. <br><br>The cortado's perfect balance of espresso and milk has made it a favorite among coffee aficionados seeking a drink that's not too strong or too milky, but just right.</p>

                    <p class="facts__description">Did you know that the Tokyo drip, also known as Kyoto-style coffee, originated in Japan and is a slow-drip brewing method that can take up to 12 hours to complete? This extended brewing time results in a smooth and mellow coffee with rich flavors and low acidity. <br><br>The Tokyo drip is made using a special apparatus consisting of a glass tower with multiple chambers, each containing ground coffee and water. <br><br>As the water slowly drips through the coffee grounds, it extracts the flavors and oils, resulting in a concentrated brew that's perfect for sipping slowly and savoring each nuanced flavor note.</p>
